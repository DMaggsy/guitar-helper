### Bugs

- Solved bugs

     - The navigation bar was not responsive on mobile devices. This was solved by adding a media query to the CSS file.
     - The contact us form was not readable on mobile due to there being no real border around the input fields. This was fixed by adding a solid border around the input fields.
     - The footer, would sometimes not stick to the bottom of the page. This was fixed by following the method presented by [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/footer.html).


- Unsolved bugs

     - None

- Mistakes

     - Mistakes were made when committing changes. As this was my first project, I was not aware of the correct way to commit changes. I have since learned the correct way to commit changes and will be using this method going forward.

- CSS

 - The CSS file was checked using the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
 - Two errors were found in the initial CSS validation. These were:

     - Line 370: "background-color: oli", instead of the intended "background-color: olive".
     - Line 515: "Property tranform doesn't exist", instead of the intended "transform: translate(0,4px)"

- Two warnings were highlighted in the initial CSS Validation. These were:

     - ":: -webkit-input-placeholder is a vendor extended pseudo element". I am aware that the webkit may lead to some warnings/errors, however the website is working perfectly and has been tested multiple times by multiple users.
     - Line 516: "No declarations in the rule", this was due to the type on "tranform" instead of "transform".

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to Github pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab located at the top of the repository page.

![Step1](documentation/Step1.png)

2. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, which is usually located near the bottom of the page.

![Step2](documentation/step2.png)

3. In the Source section, you will find a drop-down menu. Click on the drop-down menu to expand the options.

4. From the drop-down menu, select the Master Branch option. This tells GitHub Pages to use the master branch of your repository as the source for deployment.

![Step3](documentation/step3.png)

5. Once you have selected the Master Branch option, click on the Save button.

6. The page will automatically refresh to reflect the changes you made.

7. Scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section, and you will see a notification indicating that your site is being deployed. It may take a few moments for the deployment process to complete.

8. Once the deployment process is finished, you will see a message with the URL where your site is published. It will typically be in the format https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>, where <your-github-username> is your GitHub username and <repository-name> is the name of your repository.

9. Click on the URL to verify that your site has been successfully deployed. The link should open your site in a new browser tab.

<hr>

## Local Deployment

- In order to make a local copy of this project, you can clone it. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:

     - git clone https://github.com./dmaggsy/your-guitar-helper.git

<hr>

## Future Implementations

1. Custom 404 Page
 - A custom 404 page will be implemented to provide a user-friendly experience when visitors encounter a page that cannot be found. The 404 page will include relevant information, such as an apology message, suggestions for navigation, and a search bar to help users find the content they were looking for.

2. Favicon
 - A favicon will be added to enhance the website's branding and visual appeal. The favicon is a small icon that appears in the browser tab and bookmarks. It helps users quickly identify and locate your website among their open tabs or saved bookmarks.
